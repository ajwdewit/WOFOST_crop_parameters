                     The reallocation parameters were estimated for variety Armina. It was assumed that the decrease in the
                     stem and chaff dry weight was not due to mortality but due to reallocation of dry matter from the stem.
                     Therefore, the relative stem mortality rate was set to 0.0 for all development stages.
