Parameter values were added for the maximum N/P/K uptake rates. These were derived from a literature study for various
crops but because of the general lack of data the same values are current applied for all crops. Note that the impact
of the parameters on the simulation results is limited. They are mainly there to avoid that a nutrient deficient crop
can "grab" a large amount of nutrients in a single time-step.
