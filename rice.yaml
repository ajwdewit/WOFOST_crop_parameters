    Title: Parameter sets for the WOFOST7.2/WOFOST8.0 model for simulating rice
    Date: 2022-02-13
    Language: EN
    Format: YAML
    Subject: WOFOST parameters for rice
    Description: This file provides parameters for several rice varieties. Mostly calibrated based
        on observations done at the International Rice Research Institute, but also based on
        observations from Europe and earlier work.

                Description: Parameters for a rice cultivar IR72 developed at IRRI. Calibrated for the simulation
                    of crop growth on the basis of monthly weather data. Purpose of application was the assessment
                    of regional crop production potential in tropical regions. Developed in the framework of SysNet,
                    1997. This variety is based on a consolidated parameter set derived from the calibrations for
                    IR72 that were done separately for the dry and wet seasons. Note
                    that the calibration is based on experiments with transplanted rice given that DVSI > 0.
                    Parameters related to emergence are not provided and therefore this variety can only be used
                    with the simulation starting from emergence. Results are provided in "Cabrerea, J. M. C. A.,

                    of crop growth on the basis of monthly weather data. Purpose of application was the assessment
                    of regional crop production potential in tropical regions. Developed in the framework of SysNet,
                    1997. This variety is based on a parameter set derived from the calibrations for
                    IR72 that were done for the wet season only.
                    Note that the calibration is based on experiments with transplanted rice given that DVSI > 0.
                    Parameters related to emergence are not provided and therefore this variety can only be used
                    with the simulation starting from emergence. Results are provided in "Cabrerea, J. M. C. A.,
