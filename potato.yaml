    Title: Parameter sets for the WOFOST7.2/7.3 model for simulating potato
    Date: 2022-02-13
    Language: EN
    Format: YAML
    Subject: WOFOST parameters for potato
    Description: This file provides parameters for several potato varieties based to two ecotypes. The
       ecotype 'potato' is based on the original calibrations for potato mainly using cultivar 'Bintje'.
       The second ecotype 'potato_nl' is based on new experimental trials over the period 2019-2021 with
       several modern cultivars carried out at two locations in the Netherlands.

                Description: Innovator is a relatively early maturing variety that is popular due to its
                    frying and baking characteristics. It is currently growth in most of Europe and is becoming
                    popular in North America as well. Note that in the paper from Ten Den et al. (2022) reallocation
                    of stem and leaf
                    biomass was applied, which is not implemented in WOFOST 7.2. In practice between 0.5 to 1.0 ton
                    of total dry stem and leaf biomass may be translocated towards the tubers.

                Description: Premiere is a very early maturing variety and is popular as a potato for
                    processing into fries. It is currently growth in most of Europe but also in other places
                    across the World. Note that in the paper from Ten Den et al. (2022) reallocation of stem and leaf
                    biomass was applied, which is not implemented in WOFOST 7.2. In practice between 0.5 to 1.0 ton
                    of total dry stem and leaf biomass may be translocated towards the tubers.
